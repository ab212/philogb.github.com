![3D Parametric Surfaces](/assets/explorer/1.jpg)

Exploring 3D surfaces is a fun way to learn about geometry,
physical phenomena or even terrain modeling. Parametric surfaces
are surfaces that also change their shape
with an extra variable: *time*. Explore 3D surfaces by using drag
and drop and the mouse wheel to zoom in/out. You can enable the *t* parameter (by clicking on the
checkbox) and hit play to see it move. There are three predefined surfaces for you to explore or modify.

**[Click here](http://senchalabs.github.com/philogl/PhiloGL/examples/explorer/) to access the example. You will need a WebGL capable
browser (and machine).**
