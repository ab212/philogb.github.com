    Nicolas Garcia Belmonte works as a data visualization scientist at Twitter,
    where he leads the #interactive project that delivers public-facing data visualizations by Twitter
    around news, sports, politics, T.V and media.
    Nicolas authored visualizations in all verticals around media
    including Twitter's IPO videos, the elections, the Emmys,
    the Olympics, the State of the Union and others.
    Nicolas' WebGL and JavaScript libraries have been used by companies
    like Google, Mozilla and Twitter. One of his libraries (the JavaScript
    InfoVis Toolkit) was acquired by Sencha in 2010.
    His visualizations were featured in blogs like FlowingData and FastCompany and in books like Nathan Yau's Visualize This.
    Nicolas has been a speaker in several conferences on graphics, storytelling and data visualization.
